							<h3 class="bg-dark text-white p-1"> About </h3>
							<p> 
							Phantogram is an American music duo from Greenwich, New York
							, formed in 2007 and consisting of Josh Carter (vocals, guitar) and Sarah Barthel 
							(vocals, keyboards). The band name was inspired by an optical illusion called a 
							phantogram, in which two-dimensional images appear to be three-dimensional.
							</p>
							<p>
							The band define their music as electronic rock, dream pop, electronica and trip hop,
							 and have described their sound as "street beat, psych pop". According to Carter,
							their music has "lots of rhythms, swirling guitars, spacey keyboards, echoes, airy vocals".
							 Carter and Barthel were inspired by artists including: the Beatles, David Bowie,
							Cocteau Twins, J Dilla, the Flaming Lips, John Frusciante, Serge Gainsbourg, Madlib,
							Sonic Youth, Yes, Kevin Shields and Prince.
							</p>
							<p>
							They write and record in a remote barn in Upstate New York called Harmonie Lodge. 
							The band has released three studio albums (Eyelid Movies in 2010, Voices in 2014, and 
							Three in 2016), four EPs (Phantogram and Running From the Cops in 2009, Nightlife in 2011,
							Phantogram in 2013) and 10 singles.
							</p>
							
						<h3 class="bg-dark text-white p-1"> History </h3>
							<p>
							Carter and Barthel have been friends since preschool. In the summer of 2007, Barthel returned
							home dissatisfied with pursuing a visual arts degree at Champlain College in Vermont, and
							Carter returned home after a brief stint in New York City with Grand Habit, an experimental
							band formed with his older brother, John. The two friends reunited and worked on finishing 
							some of Carter's earlier songwriting ideas, then finally formed the band. 
							They played some live shows, but decided to focus the bulk of their energies on making 
							records.
							</p>
							<p>
							The duo was originally called Charlie Everywhere and used that name to perform around the 
							Saratoga Springs area and to release two EPs on local label Sub-Bombin Records. Upon 
							signing with UK label Barely Breaking Even on January 26, 2009, they changed their name to 
							Phantogram. Phantogram's eponymous debut EP was self-released on the CE Records 
							label on May 12, 2009, followed in the same year by another EP, Running From the Cops, 
							issued on BBE. They signed with Barsuk Records in October 2009, after encouragement from
							Erich Cannon of Portland's Spectre Entertainment, who contacted them after he heard songs on 
							their MySpace page. "We were going to write the record, finish it, and release it as a demo 
							for upstate," explained Barthel. "Then our plan was to move down to New York to do 
							the whole networking and meeting people kind of stuff. And we kind of skipped that whole 
							thing, just because of the internet."
							</p>
							<p>
							Phantogram released their debut album Eyelid Movies on September 15, 2009 on BBE (Europe) 
							and Indica Records (Canada), and on February 9, 2010 on Barsuk (US). The album received 
							generally favorable reviews. The album included three singles: "Mouthful of Diamonds", 
							"When I'm Small" and "As Far As I Can See".
